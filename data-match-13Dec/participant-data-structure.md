// Notes

## Empathy map

Empathy map data gives us emotional connection to the BDM allowing us to adjust our design and communications appropriately. This is also key to personalisation and ‘nudging’ if necessary.

## Business plan

Business plan data allows us to programmatically assess the business intent of the BDM. Plan data will allow more efficient triage by sector, maturity, geography etc

## Value proposition

Value proposition data will allow us to triage by likely success of the business venture. Is it a good idea or not. If not, is it improvable? If so, how exactly. Most of this could be achieved programmatically on the basis of the match between pain and gains and their promotors and mitigators.

## Business model canvas

The business model has nine data points. These each list specific needs business needs so can be used to align a support offer with the specific’s business need business. The needs can mention specifics such are resources or geography so this data can be used to triage to markets, ITA support etc.

## Opportunities for DBT ecosystem to support

The “matchmaking” interviews gave the participants space to tell the researcher everything about their business and their situation. As a result, each interview provides a basis for describing opportunities for support.
